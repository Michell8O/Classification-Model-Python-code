# Classification Model Python Code

## Digits Dataset
This dataset consists of 1797, 8Ã—8 images of hand-written digits. <br /> 
These 8x8 images then need to be converted into feature vectors of length 64. <br /> 
Each image corresponds to one of 10 classes. <br /> 


''The data set contains images of hand-written digits: 10 classes where\neach class refers to a digit.

Preprocessing programs made available by NIST were used to extract\nnormalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. 

From a\ntotal of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13\nto the test set. 

32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of\n4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. 

This generates\nan input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range\n0..16. 

This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small\ndistortions.''
